## Features

This is a small mod which adds a new item to the game, the Wanderer's Catalogue.
The Wanderer's Catalogue is a book which can be bought from Wandering Traders for 8 emeralds.
When you buy the book you can choose an item from the trader's collection, and the next time you find a Wandering Trader they will always have that item in stock.

## Using The Mod


### Buying The Book

You can buy the book from any Wandering Trader for 8 emeralds.
The book will always be the first item in the trader's collection.

### Using The Book

When you buy the book you will be presented with a list of all items which wandering traders can sell.
You can choose any item from this list and the next time you find a wandering trader they will always have that item in stock, and in a higher amount.
